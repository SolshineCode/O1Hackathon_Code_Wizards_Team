# ArXiv Paper Analyzer and Code Generator

## Overview

This project was initially created for the lablab.ai O1 Reasoning Hackathon. It aims to fetch recent Computer Science and AI papers from ArXiv, analyze their implementability, generate documentation and code samples, and present the results through a user-friendly interface.

**Note:** Due to unforeseen circumstances and all other teammates leaving or becoming unavailable, this project was not completed during the hackathon. The current codebase represents the work of a single contributor (Solshine) and is not fully functional.

## Features (Planned)

- Fetch recent papers from ArXiv's CS and AI categories
- Analyze papers for implementability using AI (intended to use O1 Reasoning API)
- Generate documentation and code samples based on paper abstracts
- Store processed data in a Hugging Face dataset
- Display results through a Gradio web interface

## Current Status

The project is currently in an incomplete state. While the basic structure and some functionalities are in place, several critical components need to be implemented or fixed before the system can be operational.

## What Needs to be Fixed

1. **ArXiv Response Parsing**: The `parse_arxiv_response` function needs to be implemented to properly extract paper details from the XML response.

2. **AI API Integration**: The current code uses OpenAI's API as a placeholder. This needs to be updated to use the O1 Reasoning API or another suitable alternative.

3. **Security**: API keys and tokens are currently hardcoded. These should be moved to environment variables or a secure configuration system.

4. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling needs to be implemented throughout the codebase to manage potential API failures, parsing errors, etc.

5. **Scalability**: The current setup only fetches 5 papers. This should be made configurable and potentially support pagination for larger datasets.

6. **Data Management**: The Hugging Face dataset management needs refinement, possibly implementing strategies for updating or appending to existing data rather than overwriting.

7. **Testing**: A comprehensive test suite should be developed to ensure reliability of all components.
